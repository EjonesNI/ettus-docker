### Using the Docker file

## Build the docker image from source

To build this container from source, navigate to this directory and run:

    sudo docker build -t ettusresearch/oe-build .

## Building an SD card image using the Docker container

Navigate to a location with sufficient disk space. There, create a new directory
called `oe-builder`, and make it writable by everyone. Also copy the default
user files like .bashrc:

    mkdir oe-builder && chmod 777 oe-builder && cp -r /etc/skel/. oe-builder

Then run the Docker container:

    docker run -i -t -v $(pwd)/oe-builder:/home/oe-builder:rw,z ettusresearch/oe-build /bin/bash

Note the order of the naming above might vary by Docker version, sometimes it
might need to be:

    docker run -i -t ettusresearch/oe-build -v $(pwd)/oe-builder:/home/oe-builder:rw,z /bin/bash

After running the previous command, you will be inside the container.
The first time you run the Docker container, you need to setup the layers.
There are various ways to do this, the easiest is to refer to a branch or tag
on the oe-manifests repository, and have it instantiate the defaults. Here, we
grab the defaults from the `thud` branch:

    repo init -u git://github.com/EttusResearch/oe-manifests.git -b thud
    repo sync

Note: You can also run the repo commands outside of the container, as long as
you stay in the oe-builder directory. This might help with missing ssh keys, if
you're cloning the git repositories via ssh. To use ssh, adapt the `repo init`
command as follows:

    repo init -u ssh://git@github.com/EttusResearch/oe-manifests.git -b thud

Recent versions of meta-ettus contain a script that will automate building a
filesystem for you. For example, if you want to build an N310 filesystem, run
the following command from your home directory:

    ./meta-ettus/contrib/build_imgs_package.sh n3xx v3.15.0.0

Note this will not only build the filesystem, but it will also zip it up in the
same way files are packaged for shipping with `uhd_image_downloader`. If you experiences failures post build and SDK such as "name not matched", "missing file or directory" then update build_imgs_package.sh commenting line TMP_OUTPUT_DIR=tmp-musl and uncommenting TMP_OUTPUT_DIR=tmp-glibc.

If you prefer a more manual process, refer to `meta-ettus/contrib/setup_build_env.sh`
which has encoded all the settings used for building official filesystem releases.

More information on the configuration options and the required layers is
provided in the `meta-ettus/README` file
([the latest version is available here](https://github.com/EttusResearch/meta-ettus)).
It lists the supported values for `MACHINE` which look something like this:

    MACHINE="ni-sulfur-rev6-mender" # for N3xx
    MACHINE="ni-neon-rev2-mender" # for E320
    MACHINE="ni-e31x-mender-sg3" # for E310, Speedgrade 3

Then, you can invoke bitbake to build the image:

    bitbake developer-image

To build the according SDK, run

    bitbake developer-image -cpopulate_sdk

Note that "developer-image" is the name of the build target.
